Credit Risk Analysis Report

Overview

In this challenge I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. The goal of the analysis was to predict healthy loans and high-risk loans for financial institutions based on creaditworthiness of borrowers. By predicting loan risk, financial institutions can make quick informed decisions on loan approvals and reduce their risk of high-risk borrowers.

Results

Accuracy Score: The accuracy score of the machine learning model is 0.99, indicating that it correctly predicts loan status 99% of the time.
Precision Score:
Healthy Loan (Class 0): 1.00
High-risk Loan (Class 1): 0.85
Recall Score:
Healthy Loan (Class 0): 0.99
High-risk Loan (Class 1): 0.95
F1 Score:
Healthy Loan (Class 0): 1.00
High-risk Loan (Class 1): 0.89

Summary

The machine learning model wad great for predicting healthy loans with a high precision, recall, and F1 score. It does not perform as well in the high-risk loans with precision at only 85% correct, it is higher in the recall at 95%, and balanced at F1 at 89%. Given the model's prediction of loan risk it can be beneficial to financial organizations to utilize the model for loan approvals and improve risk mitigating procedures which can impact the organizations profits.
